\f0\fs36 \cf0     I really do not know why "mvn clean install" command couldn't create a runnable jar. but I find that using "mvn clean assembly:assembly" instead do really work. So if you want to compile , it is really suggested. \
    And I feel sorry for submitting the code so late, if you have any problem understanding the codes, you can contact me by cellphone or any other ways such as E-mail.\
\
    Again, thanks for your time reading my codes and I'm looking forward to your reply.}
